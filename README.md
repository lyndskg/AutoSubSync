# AutoSubSync

AutoSubSync is an innovative coding project that aims to automatically sync subtitle track files to movies and other videos. The project utilizes speech recognition and alignment algorithms to analyze the video's audio and align the subtitle timings, ensuring accurate and synchronized subtitles for a seamless viewing experience.

## Key Features:
1. Speech Recognition: Implement a speech recognition module using ML models to transcribe the audio from the video into text.
2. Subtitle Alignment: Utilize alignment algorithms to match the transcribed audio with the corresponding subtitle track, ensuring proper synchronization.
3. Multilingual Support: Support multiple languages for subtitle synchronization to cater to a global audience.
4. Real-Time Sync: Explore real-time synchronization options for users to view subtitles as they watch the video.
5. User Interface: Develop an intuitive user interface where users can upload videos and subtitle files for synchronization.
6. Quality Control: Implement mechanisms to verify the accuracy and coherence of the synced subtitle tracks.
7. Batch Processing: Allow users to sync subtitle tracks for multiple videos simultaneously for convenience.
8. Subtitle Format Conversion: Support the conversion of subtitle files into different formats compatible with various video players.


## Best Coding Languages:
Python is well-suited for this project, as it offers robust ML libraries and tools for speech recognition and alignment tasks. You can use libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch for speech recognition, and alignment algorithms can be implemented using Python's built-in functions.


## Basic Workflow:
1. Audio Transcription: Use ML models for speech recognition to convert the video's audio into text.
2. Subtitle File Preparation: Ensure that the subtitle track file is in a suitable format for synchronization.
3. Subtitle Alignment: Implement alignment algorithms to match the transcribed audio with the subtitle timings, adjusting for any delays or discrepancies.
4. Synchronization and Overlay: Sync the subtitle text with the video's audio, overlaying the subtitles at the appropriate timestamps.
5. Real-Time Sync (Optional): Explore options for real-time subtitle synchronization, enabling viewers to see subtitles as they watch the video.
6. Quality Control: Implement checks to ensure the accuracy and coherence of the synced subtitle tracks.
7. Batch Processing: Allow users to sync subtitle tracks for multiple videos simultaneously to save time.
8. User Interface: Develop an easy-to-use interface for video upload, subtitle file selection, and synchronization.


AutoSubSync aims to automate the subtitle synchronization process, providing users with accurately timed subtitles for their videos, regardless of the language or content. This project will be valuable for content creators and viewers who seek a seamless and enjoyable experience when watching subtitled videos.
